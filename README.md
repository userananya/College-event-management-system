My College has several clubs which hosts different events throughout the year, but there was no common platform where student can look for all the events of different clubs at a glance to register for the events. So I have designed a common single portal for all the events. On this platform students can browse all the clubs and their corresponding events and can register themselves easily. Organizers can maintain the database of clubs, events and student registration.
